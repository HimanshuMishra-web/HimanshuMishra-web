Hi there, I'm Himanshu Mishra! ðŸ‘‹
About Me
I'm a passionate and results-driven Frontend-focused Full Stack Developer with 3+ years of experience building high-performance, scalable web applications using React, Node.js, and TypeScript. I am passionate about delivering clean, responsive UI/UX, real-time features, and working on impactful digital products. I strongly believe in component-based architecture, reusable code, and performance optimization.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on SmartCV, an AI-powered Resume Builder. This mobile-responsive app is built with React + TypeScript and integrates the OpenAI API to offer AI-driven content suggestions for resumes.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m constantly learning and exploring new ways to enhance web application performance and user experience.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on innovative web development projects, especially those involving AI integration, real-time features, or robust backend systems.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m always open to discussing efficient architectural patterns and advanced state management in React.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about React, Node.js, TypeScript, MongoDB, GraphQL, and building scalable web applications.
